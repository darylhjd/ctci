The solution here is to keep 2 separate queues for Dogs and Cats, and store a timestamp for each animal
that was added to the shelter.

When we want to remove a particular animal type, we can just dequeue from the relevant animal queue, and if we just want
to take out the oldest animal, we can compare the timestamps for the Dog and Cat queue and remove the older animal.

This solution will help to decrease the amount of iteration through any sort of data structure.
